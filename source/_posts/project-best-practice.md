# Best Practice

In the last couple of days I spend some time of learning more about Junit5. I did my way through some online courses on Pluralsight. During the analysis on the material from the course, I realized that there are some good ideas on how to solve a specific task. I was wondering because, I have solved these tasks over and over again in the past, but every a little bit different. The differences are not because of the different domain logic, but because of the used framework or routines that allow to solve a specific problems and different ways. Some solutions looks better than the other or is less easy to understand.

So I had the idea of just starting a collection of **Best Practice** solutions. They depend heavily on the programming language of choice and the used framework. I will need to a way to structure these things inside the repository or use multiple repository. I'm not sure about the best solution here.

## best Practice Spring

Since I was thrown into a Spring based project, I will start with collecting best practices for Spring Java.
